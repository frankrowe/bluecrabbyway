The City Park owes its existence to the failure of the Humphrey’s Lake mill dam on May 29, 1909. After the lake was drained, the area east of the railroad bridge was an abandoned wasteland. In 1925, Salisbury Mayor Thomas L Parker Sr. negotiated the purchase of the 53 acre exposed lake bottom for $5000, in order to construct a new municipal water plant and well field.  Since the new water system only took up a small portion of the lake bottom, the balance of the land was developed as the municipal park. In 1927, Mayor Parker appointed the first Park Commission to oversee the park.\nWinding through the early park was the east prong of the Wicomico River, spanned by a series of simple timber footbridges. The devastating Atlantic storm of August 1933 damaged the Schumaker Lake dam, flooding the park and destroying most of the improvements.  In the years following this storm, with aid from Depression Era federal work programs such as the WPA, the park lands were redesigned and improved with trees, shrubs, bridges, roads and walkways.

In 1778 the first Methodist Society of Salisbury was formed and in the 1790's the present lot on Division St. was purchased.  In 1801, the first Methodist church known as the \"Old Red Meeting House\" was built on this lot.  The congregation incorporated on August 22, 1807 as \"The Methodist Episcopal Church in the vicinity of Salisbury.\"\n\nIn 1856, a white frame church with green shutters was erected but was destroyed in the great Salisbury Fire of 1886.  Following the fire the \"Old Red Meeting House\" was again used for worship (as well as the Salisbury Post Office) until the present stone church building was completed in 1887.  The name of the congregation was then changed to Asbury Methodist Church.  In 1963 Asbury Methodist Church relocated near Salisbury University and the building was unused until 1966. \n\nLate 1950's, five local couples from Salisbury contacted Rev. J. Harvey Dixon about there not being services conducted at the Wicomico County Jail or Pine Bluff State Tubercular Hospital.  Rev. Dixon with this group began to hold services in both these institutions on a weekly basis.  Rev. Dixon had been an ordained minister with the Holiness Christian Church of the United States of America, Inc. since 1953.  But in 1965 he resigned from the Holiness Christian Church and joined with this group to form an independent community church.  This group incorporated as The Faith Community Church of Salisbury, Maryland, Inc. in 1966 and purchased this old landmark church.  Their goal was to restore it as a desirable place to worship and to promote Biblical values in the community.\n•  The \"Old Red Meeting House\" was built 18 years before a stove was installed.\n•  A tombstone in the graveyard is that of Sallie Brewington, daughter of one of the incorporators.  She died on her wedding day.

One of the roads was the dividing line between Somerset and Worcester Counties, making the village politically fragmented until 1867, when Wicomico County was formed from portions of the two counties.     About 1820, the village became known as Forktown, because it was located at the fork of two roads which were used by stage coaches traveling north and south. The stage coach route originated in Accomac, Virginia and continued to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The stage coaches would stop at Forktown, change horses and continue on their way. Fruitland City Hall is now at the site of this historic location. When the railroad arrived at the conclusion of the Civil War more development shifted to the area of the railroad. In 1873, the name of the town was changed to Fruitland because of the large number of fruits growing and being harvested in the area.                                                                   Fruitland was not incorporated until 1947 when the population began to expand rapidly because of its closeness to Salisbury.\nFruitland held the first (and largest) holly auction every year for three days in December, from the late 1890s until December 1968. The demand for homemade wreaths decreased as artificial wreaths were manufactured. Besides holly, mistletoe was also sold by the bushel basket at the auctions. Wreaths were sold and shipped to brokers in Baltimore, Philadelphia and Washington, DC, but sometimes were shipped as far west as Chicago.\n","DateOfSite":"","NationalRegister":"","MD Inventory":"Yes   - cannot find on mht site but is mht marker","In Historic District":"","MD Military Monuments":"","Website":"http://www.cityoffruitland.com/userfiles/image/Scan_Pic0046.jpg","Website addl":"","Category Secondary":"","Additional Information":"","Photo":"http://apps.esrgc.org/scenicbyway/img/FruitlandMHT.jpg","Data Source":"","Contact Name":"","Contact Email":"","Contact Phone":""},{"Name":"Gen John Henry Winder","Category":"Historic Marker","StreetAddress1":"Division and Main Street","City":"Salisbury","County":"Wicomico","State":"MD","Zip":"21801","location":"38.365516666666664,-75.60053333333333","Route":"Ocean City to Princess Anne","Description":"","DescriptionLong":"Sign was erected by MD Civil War Centennial Commission.

Poplar Hill Mansion was built in 1795-96 as the manor house of a farm outside the small eighteenth century town of Salisbury from a port landing site at the head of the Wicomico River, more than a half mile away.  Construction was begun by Major Levin Handy, originally from Newport, Rhode Island. In 1795 the Major took out a deed for 357 acres of the original 700 acre land patent called \"Pembertons Good Will.\" The house Handy began in 1795-96 was an ambitious Federal-style structure, outdistancing most buildings in the area in size and fine detail. The house was still incomplete.                         In 1805 the title was passed to a prominent physician in Salisbury, Dr. John Huston. When the Doctor died in 1828 there were fruit trees, vegetable crops, sheep, cattle, and eighteen slaves on the property, as well as $110 \"cash on hand.\" Huston's widow Sarah inherited the property. In the late 1840s to early 1850s, she partially subdivided it, overseeing the laying out of Poplar Hill Avenue and Isabella Street. The subdivision of \"Poplar Farm\" continued at a moderate rate before the Civil War. From the 1870s until World War One, the extended area experienced a building boom, creating Salisbury's first suburb, or \"Newtown.\" Mrs. Huston left Poplar Hill to her daughter Elizabeth. Elizabeth initiated its sale to George Waller in 1881. (Elizabeth and her sister Isabella are commemorated in the names of neighborhood streets.)  George Waller and his family lived in the house from 1882 to 1945. Various early photos and memorabilia belonging to the Wallers are located in the Mansion’s archives.                                  Fred A. Adkins, who purchased the property in 1945, undertook restoration work with the hope of turning the house into the local Masonic Lodge. In 1948, when this failed to materialize, the house passed to Mr. and Mrs. Ward A. Garber, who maintained an 18th century period antique shop downstairs and lived upstairs. Mrs. Garber sold the property to Wicomico County in 1970 and since 1974 the City of Salisbury has owned it since as a house museum.","DateOfSite":"1795","NationalRegister":"1971","MD Inventory":"1996 WI8","In Historic District":"yes","MD Military Monuments":"","Website":"http://www.poplarhillmansion.org\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poplar_Hill_Mansion\nhttp://mht.maryland.gov/nr/NRDetail.aspx?HDID=58&COUNTY =Wicomico&FROM=NRCountyList.aspx?COUNTY=Wicomico ","Website addl":"http://mht.maryland.gov/nr/NRDetail.aspx?HDID=58&COUNTY =Wicomico&FROM=NRCountyList.aspx?COUNTY=Wicomico ","Category Secondary":"","Additional Information":"","Photo":"http://apps.esrgc.org/scenicbyway/img/poplarHillMansion.jpg","Data Source":"","Contact Name":"Lower Eastern Shore Heritage Council","Contact Email":"ludwig@lowershoreheritage.org","Contact Phone":"410-677-4706"},{"Name":"Port Exchange ","Category":"Historic Site","StreetAddress1":"Mill Street and Main St","City":"Salisbury","County":"Wicomico","State":"MD","Zip":"","location":"38.365018, -75.603923","Route":"Ocean City to Princess Anne","Description":"","DescriptionLong":"*Built in stages shortly after the Great Fire in 1886.

Baltimore, Chesapeake and Atlantic Railroad Company purchased the Eastern Shore Steamboat, Salisbury steamboat Enoch Pratt then replaced by the Tivoli, then the Virginia, then the Joppa” \n\n“In 1830 a man named George Weems introduced steamboats to the Wicomico River. Weems saw the necessity of steamboat travel to what had become the “thriving community” of Salisbury.  [8] Later that year Weems’ steamboat the Patuxent became the first steamboat to reach Salisbury. The Patuxent began sailing for Salisbury on a regular basis, but the river’s shallow depth and sharp turns at times limited its voyage to Whitehaven, a small fishing community several miles southwest of Salisbury In addition to the shipping of bulk cargo, the Patuxent served as a general store when it came to town. When the Patuxent set out from the Maryland wharf in Baltimore business-minded Weems made sure it was stocked full of merchandise from Baltimore and beyond, which he dealt to consumers on an individual basis. The Patuxent continued to make the trip from Baltimore up the Wicomico on and off over the next few decades, depending on the river’s depth and recent success of crops”* “Although the Patuxent was successful dealing in Salisbury, the difficult travel on the Wicomico’s upper reaches limited other ships to destinations south of Salisbury. In the 1840’s and 50’s steamships such as the Franklin, the Thomas Jefferson, and the Hugh Jenkins found success dealing on the Wicomico at Whitehaven and Shad PointTwo years later, the Wilson Small made its way up the Wicomico to Cotton Patch, a wharf and warehouse located two miles below Salisbury”*” In 1903 the BC&A introduced a new steamboat, the Virginia, to the Wicomico River Route. Departing Baltimore from Pratt Street at 5:00pm Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, the Virginia arrived at its steamboat wharf next to the Salisbury Roller Flour Mill at 9:00am the next morning.

Seven Rosenwald Schools were built in Wicomico County.\nThe first school at this location, built around 1875, was a single story, one-room plan frame building that served the Sharptown District for over forty years. Built in 1919 to replace the first school, this two-story, hip roofed frame structure was financed creatively by several sources including Wicomico County as well as local residents who donated the land, timber and part of the labor. The lot on which the school stands was donated by community residents William L. and Mary Brown. A third source of funding was provided by Julius Rosenwald, president of the Sears, Roebuck & Co. The Julius Rosenwald Fund, administered through Booker T. Washington's Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute, supported the construction of new and improved schools for black children throughout the Southern states during the early twentieth century.  This school building remained in county use until 1961 when it was sold by the Board of Education.

The Mother Church of Stepney Parish, Old Green Hill Church, is still standing downriver on the bank of the Wicomico River 14 miles west of here. ","DescriptionLong":"First Church\nA chapel (known as Salisbury Chapel) was first built on this site in 1768, a simple brick colonial church with clear glass windows, box pews, a gallery on three sides, and a simple chancel with a wooden cross.  There has been continuous worship at this site since 1768.  Salisbury Chapel was a chapel of Stepney Parish when it was established. After American Independence, by 1791 Stepney Parish became a parish within the Diocese of Maryland, a diocese of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the U.S.  In 1827 Stepney Parish was divided and the church in Salisbury became the Chapel of Ease of Spring Hill Parish (St. Paul’s in Hebron was the main church of Spring Hill Parish).  By 1843 the church was called St. Peter’s Chapel.  Fire on August 9, 1860 destroyed the colonial church.  Few items were salvaged: 2 solid silver candlesticks, an instruction card, an ancient bookmark.  The Civil War prevented it from being rebuilt.\n\nSecond Church\nSecond church built by 1868. Romanesque style, with a large rose window on the west wall, three stained glass windows on the east wall.  Pews and communion rail were of walnut and the columns led the eye to a beamed ceiling.  A bell tower contained a large, deep-toned bell used to call members to services, and to serve as the town’s fire alarm.  In 1868 the General Convention approved the division of the Diocese of Maryland and the parish became part of the new Diocese of Easton.  Parsons Cemetery on North Division St. was established in 1873 from a bequest of land by parishioner Benjamin Parsons as a parish cemetery.  It continues today as the cemetery of St. Peter’s, Salisbury Parish.   Diocesan Convention established Salisbury Parish in 1879, separating it from Spring Hill Parish and declaring the boundaries of the parish to be “within the corporate limits of the town.”  The Great Fire of Salisbury, Sunday, October 18, 1886 destroyed the second church.  Only the candelabra, cross, an eagle lectern and a few holy vessels (on display in the Parish Museum) were saved.   All that remained were four roofless charred walls.\n\nThird Church\nBuilding the third (and present) church began soon after the fire; the first service was held on Christmas Eve 1887, and the structure was completed in 1888.   The present church was built on the same foundation as the second church.  Architect for the present church building was Thomas Burns of Philadelphia; building contractor was Slemons and Jones  The building design is Italian Romanesque (“13th Century Lombardy); the interior is a traditional basilica plan.  After the 1868 fire the bell was recast in 1888 in Baltimore and since the bell tower was not completely rebuilt, the church’s bell was installed instead in the Courthouse a block away.   Pulpit installed in 1888 as a gift from the Church of the Annunciation in Philadelphia. The Baptismal Font was installed and dedicated in 1894.  Around 1894 a storm blew out the rose window and damaged the unfinished bell tower.  Once the debt on the church was paid, on St. Peter’s Day, June 29, 1901, the Bishop of Easton, the Rt. Rev. William Forbes Adams, consecrated the building to the service of Almighty God.  In 1914 the third story and the tower belfry were completed.  In 1915 the church was redecorated to resemble how it appears today.   In  1998 the bell was moved to its present location in St. Peter’s bell tower with the stipulation that the bell was to continue to ring the hours for the city as had been done for 100 years at the Courthouse.

Built in 1913-14 near the junction where the New York, Philadelphia & Norfolk Railroad intersected with the Baltimore, Chesapeake and Atlantic Railroad, this Colonial Revival building stands out as the most elaborate passenger facility to survive on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. Superbly crafted of Flemish bond brick walls with glazed header accents and trimmed with stone-like terra cotta cornices, corner quoins, keystones, and window sills, Union Station is dramatically emblematic of the early-20th century resurgence of neoclassicism following the World Columbian Exposition held in Chicago in 1893. The new wave of neoclassicism included reinterpretations of colonial American designs and construction practices that contrasted sharply with the eclecticism and romanticism of Victorian aesthetics that had dominated American architectural designs since the third quarter of the 19th century.  Union Station is also historically significant for its association with the development of railroad transportation on the Eastern Shore. Due to its location and elaborate construction, Union Station is one of the major transportation landmarks of railroad history on the Eastern Shore, built during the period when the peninsular rail system had achieved its full maturity and influence for the region. Important as well is the aspect of cooperation and coordination inherent in the construction of Union Station by two independent railroad companies for the common good of the public traveling. Converted from a passenger station into a freight facility around 1958, the building was sold by Consolidated Railroads of Pennsylvania in 1986, and it has been used for other commercial purposes since then. The main block is 1 1/2-stories, five bays by two. The Flemish bond is highlighted by a glazed header checkerboard pattern. At the foundation level there is a cut granite stone base to the Flemish bond brick watertable accented with a cut stone-like cap executed in molded terra cotta or perhaps concrete. The surfaces of all the stone-like accents have decorative ridging that imitates tool marks as if the material was truly cut stone.","DateOfSite":"1913-14","NationalRegister":"2007","MD Inventory":"WI-150","In Historic District":"","MD Military Monuments":"","Website":"","Website addl":"","Category Secondary":"","Additional Information":"","Photo":"http://apps.esrgc.org/scenicbyway/img/unionStation.jpg","Data Source":"National Register","Contact Name":"Lower Eastern Shore Heritage Area Council","Contact Email":"ludwig@lowershoreheritage.org","Contact Phone":"410-677-4706"},{"Name":"Upper Ferry","Category":"Historic Site","StreetAddress1":"Route 349","City":"Salisbury","County":"Wicomico","State":"MD","Zip":"21802","location":"38.340953, -75.695452","Route":"Ocean City to Princess Anne","Description":"","DescriptionLong":"Upper Ferry, a smaller two-car ferry used currently by hundreds of area residents.
